# power_outages
This project uses major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. Here, a major power  outage is defined as a power outage that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of atleast 300MW. Interesting questions to consider include: - Where and when do major power outages tend to occur? - What are the characteristics of major power outages with higher severity? Variables to consider include location, time, climate, land-use characteristics, electricity consumption patterns, economic characteristics, etc. What risk factors may an energy company want to look into when predicting the location and severity of its next major power outage? - What characteristics are associated with each category of cause? - How have characteristics of major power outages changed over time? Is there a clear trend?
